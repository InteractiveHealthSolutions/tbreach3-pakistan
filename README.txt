== Description ==
TB REACH 3 aka Sehatmand Zindagi aims to increase case detection and case holding of TB patients by providing conditional cash transfer to General Practitioners and Community Mobilizers. 
The software modules were designed using Java frameworks and MySQL. Core functions include:
- Case detection module
- Case holding (treatment) module
- Reporting module
- Event alerts

== Sub-projects ==
- tbr3barcode: Java Swing application, used to generate QR codes for Patient IDs in bulk
- tbr3datawarehouse: Java Console application used to build/update data warehouse from all databases (openmrs, fieldmonitoring, ilms, tbr3_treatment)
- tbr3fieldmonitoring: GWT based web application to handle field monitoring data from Android client
- tbr3ilmssync: Java Console application used to synchronize ILMS (3rd party system) data in MS SQL Server database with ilms database in central server
- tbr3mobile: Android application used in the field to collect screening and field monitoring data
- tbr3reporterweb: GWT based web application to dynamically add reports designed in iReports for Data warehouse reports
- tbr3sync: SQL script based deprecated project for synchronization. Will be discarded once latest project is live
- tbr3synchronizer: Java Console application to synchronize data between local instances of OpenMRS and central OpenMRS
- tbreach3web: Web application to handle Screening data from Android client
- tbrmobileweb_omrs_tbr3: no longer in use
- XpertResultGetter-tbr3-khi: XpertSMS application to pull data from GeneXpert and send to OpenMRS

== Installation ==
1. Install Oracle Java v6.0.x or higher 
2. Install tomcat v6.0.x
3. Install MySQL Server v5.0 or higher
4. Install OpenMRS 1.9.x with compatible HTML Forms entry module


--------- Server ---------
1. Installing pre-requisites
a. apt-get install mysql
b. apt-get install tomcat6

2. Creating SSL certificate
a. keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias ihscertificate -keystore ihscertificate.ks -validity 720 -keysize 1024

3. Creating PEM format file (standard format for openSSL)
* This file is used by the client (android) to shake hand with the server on secure socket

-- After creating certificate and configuring tomcat --
1. Open website and view certificate
2. Export certificate as pem file
3. Install Keystore Explorer
4. Create new keystore and import certificate exported previously
5. Save keystore as .ks file, this will be loaded as a raw resource in your Android client
-- End certificate thing

4. Enabling SSL encryption on Tomcat
a. nano /var/lib/tomcat6/conf/server.xml
b. Search and uncomment the commented block for configuring SSL HTTP connector (by default, it's on port 8443)
 <Connector port="8443" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true"
               maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"
               clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS" />
c. Set protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol", add keystoreFile="/home/myhome/IHSCertificate.cert" and password (if provided while creating the certificate)
    <Connector port="8443" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol" SSLEnabled="true"
               maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"
               clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS" 
               keystoreFile="/home/myhome/ihscertificate.cer" 
               keystorePass="mysslcertificatepassword" />
d. Save the file and exit the editor
e. service tomcat6 restart
f. In the browser, goto "https://localhost:8443"
g. If the browser warns about untrusted source. Ignore and proceed by adding the website as an exception.

5. Install OpenMRS
a. Goto "https://localhost:8443/manager/html"
b. Deploy the provided "openmrs.war" file and launch
c. Do the initial setup and start OpenMRS

6. Add openmrs database restore procedure
...

7. Restricting OpenMRS to HTTPS only
a. nano /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/openmrs/WEB-INF/web.xml
b. Add the following text at the end, just before ending tag:
<security-constraint>
	<web-resource-collection>
		<web-resource-name>HTTPSOnly</web-resource-name>
		<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
	</web-resource-collection>
	<user-data-constraint>
		<transport-guarantee>CONFIDENTIAL</transport-guarantee>
	</user-data-constraint>
</security-constraint>
c. service tomcat6 restart

7. Installing required modules
- HTML Form Entry Module:
- Reporting Module:
- Reporting Compatability Module:
- Usage Statistics Module:
- Address Hierarchy Module:
- Metadata Sharing Module:
- REST Module:

8. Troubleshooting memory leak issue
- nano /var/lib/tomcat6/conf/web.xml file
- In the jsp servlet definition add the following element:
<init-param>
	<param-name>enablePooling</param-name>
	<param-value>false</param-value>
</init-param>
- If the above doesn't work out, try the following:
- nano /etc/init.d/tomcat6
- Change (~line 81):

FROM:
if [ -z "$JAVA_OPTS" ]; then
        JAVA_OPTS="-Djava.awt.headless=true -Xmx128M"
fi

TO:

if [ -z "$JAVA_OPTS" ]; then
        JAVA_OPTS="-Djava.awt.headless=true -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -XX:NewSize=128m"
fi

--------- Client ---------
2. Installing required applications
a. Install Barcode application from Google Playstore
b. Install "tbreach3mobile.apk" copied to the memory
c. Copy tutorial videos to the memory

3. Disable unwanted applications
...

4. Setting up application preferences
...
